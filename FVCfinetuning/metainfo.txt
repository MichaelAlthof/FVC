Published in: Face Value of Companies

Description: "Finetunes an Convolutional Neural Network that classifies facial expressions into seven basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, surprise). The underlying deep convolutional net is trained on VGGface. Image based static facial expression recognition with multiple deep network learning. The original dataset can be obtained from kaggle's 'Facial Expression Recognition Challenge'. The subfolder 'model weights' contains model weights and model architecture in .json-Format. This allows to access the estimation results without rerunning the calculations. VGGFace implementation on keras by github.com/rcmalli/keras-vggface. "


Keywords: neural-network, estimation, empirical, optimization, descending-gradients
